Open educational resources (OER) are free and (re)distributable teaching materials. This site is a sponsored by the [Ursula Schwerin Library](https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/library/) to select and curate resources for use in General Biology 1. This was extended to include Molecular & Cell Biology through the U.S. Department of Education Title V Grant, "[A Living Lab](https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/livinglab/living-lab/)". This site was originally authored and curated by Jeremy Seto, Department of Biological Sciences - New York City College of Technology. In the spirit of remixing and redistribution, the entire WordPress site can be downloaded from GitHub as well as customized imagery (https://github.com/jeremyseto/bio-oer).
